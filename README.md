# SAC:Soft Actor Critic_implementation

This is a Tensorflow implementation of the 'Continuous control with Deep Reinforcement learning' paper(Both of the jupyter notebook and python script is used for the 'main' file)

Paper=> [Soft actor critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290)

### Env:Pendulum-v0 (with normalization and OU Noise)

Note:In the title of the above plot,there should be '250 scores' instead of '100 scores'
